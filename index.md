We gladly announce the workshop on **Shape** in **M**edical **I**maging (SHAPEMI), which is held in conjunction with the conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Interventions ([MICCAI 2018](http://www.miccai2018.org/en/)) in Granada, Spain. This workshop arises from the previous MICCAI [SeSAMI](https://sites.google.com/site/sesami2016/) and [SAMI](https://sites.google.com/site/miccaisami2015/) Workshops as well as the [Shape Symposium](http://www.shapesymposium.org) 2015 and 2014. It will provide a presentation venue for researchers working in shape/geometric modeling, learning, analysis, statistics, classification and applications. 

Today’s image data often represents continuous and time-varying phenomena, usually with a geometric structure. Shape and geometry processing methods are receiving increased attention, for example, due to their higher sensitivity to local variations relative to traditional markers, such as the volume of a structure. Shape and spectral analysis and modeling algorithms, as well as application-driven research, are essential to the essence of this workshop. Shape analysis methods are broadly applicable to many different fields from medical image computing to paleontology, anthropology and beyond.


This workshop targets theoretical contributions as well as exciting applications in medical imaging, including (but not limited to):
- Shape Processing and Analysis
- Shape Learning and Classification
- Geometric Learning and Manifold-based Methods
- Statistics of Shapes and Deformations
- Spectral Shape Analysis
- Spectral Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction
- Shape Modeling and Representation
- Shape Segmentation, Registration and Correspondence
- Longitudinal Shape Analysis and Processing
- Medical Applications focused on Shape Analysis
- Evaluation / quality assessment of shape models
- Relevant demos of freely available shape analysis software
