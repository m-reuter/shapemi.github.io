What can I do using SlicerSALT?
---------------------
SlicerSALT is the dissemination vehicle of powerful shape analysis methodology based on 3D Slicer open-source software.

* Compute Point Distributed Models (PDM) using Spherical Harmonic Representation (SPHARM-PDM)
* Run 4D regression in a collection of 3D PDMs associated to a linear variable (i.e. age)
* Perform correspondence optimization using study-wise shape analysis
* Fit skeletal representations (s-reps) to a collection of binary volumes
* Compute image-based correspondence in binary volumes of different topologies
* Use advanced shape statistics for scientific hypothesis testing
* Visualize, edit, and register multimodal data using 3D Slicer tools
* Access all functionality through the graphical user interface
* Perform command line batch processing
* Extended and improved shape analysis functionality is coming soon in Slicer...
